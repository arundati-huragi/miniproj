Alternative Email Provider Setup Instructions:

If you prefer not to use Gmail SMTP due to 2-Step Verification or "Less secure app access" restrictions, you can use a transactional email service provider. These services offer reliable SMTP servers and APIs for sending emails securely.

Popular options include:

1. SendGrid
   - Sign up at https://sendgrid.com/
   - Create an API key for SMTP
   - Use smtp.sendgrid.net as EMAIL_HOST
   - Use port 587 or 465
   - Use your SendGrid username (usually "apikey") as EMAIL_USER
   - Use the API key as EMAIL_PASS

2. Mailgun
   - Sign up at https://www.mailgun.com/
   - Verify your domain
   - Get SMTP credentials from the dashboard
   - Use smtp.mailgun.org as EMAIL_HOST
   - Use port 587 or 465
   - Use your Mailgun SMTP username and password

3. Amazon SES
   - Set up AWS SES service
   - Verify your domain/email
   - Generate SMTP credentials
   - Use the provided SMTP endpoint as EMAIL_HOST
   - Use port 587 or 465
   - Use SMTP username and password from AWS SES

General Steps to Configure:
- Update your .env file with the new EMAIL_HOST, EMAIL_PORT, EMAIL_USER, and EMAIL_PASS values.
- Restart your backend server to apply changes.
- Test sending emails using the new provider.

Would you like me to help you set up one of these providers or generate example .env configurations for them?
